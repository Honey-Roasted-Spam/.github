# Honey Roasted Spam

What's with the name?

Well, It's simple really, we honeytrap then roast the spammer hosts.

By roast, though, I mean, politely and calmly name and shame hosting and infrastructure providers that continue to do nothing
when spammers continue to use their networks.

The services developed here will allow for indexing and reporting on incoming spam to someones domain/mailserver,
completes the ownership lookups, and prepares an evidence pack to have that user banned from the hosts network.

Submitted report metadata is then OPTIONALLY returned to our servers, which will then compile reports including statistics sources
so if needed, we can request evidence for any prosecution (yes, that's right, it's not only annoying as hell, but IT'S ILLEGAL!)
